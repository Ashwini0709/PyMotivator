# PyMotivator
This is a Python program that intends to send motivational or inspirational quotes on WhatsApp on a daily basis. These quotes are motivational by default but can be changed to funny, sports related, etc if required.

This project will have two main modules, one would fetch a quote from a Quote of the Day API and send a WhatsApp text using a Third Party Service. The other module will be a cron scheduler that will schedule these WhatsApp texts to send everyday.

Implementing robust security measures in this project ensures data integrity, protects user privacy, and mitigates potential threats. All the keys and passwords to be stored as Environment variables.
